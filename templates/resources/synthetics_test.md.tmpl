#### *Warning*
Starting from version 3.1.0+, the direct usage of global variables in the configuration is deprecated, in favor of
local variables of type `global`. As an example, if you were previously using `{{ "{{ GLOBAL_VAR }}" }}` directly in your
configuration, you now need to add a `configVariable` of type `global` and whose `id` must be the `id` 
of the global variable `GLOBAL_VAR` (you can find it in Synthetics UI) and whose name can be chosen freely. 
In practice, it means going from (simplified configuration):
```
url = {{ "https://{{ GLOBAL_VAR }}" }}
```
to
```
url = {{ "https://{{ LOCAL_VAR }}" }}
configVariable = {name: "LOCAL_VAR", id: GLOBAL_VAR.id, type: "global"}
```
