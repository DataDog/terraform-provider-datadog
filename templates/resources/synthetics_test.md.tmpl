#### *Warning*
Starting from version 3.1.0+, the direct usage of global variables in the configuration is deprecated, in favor of
local variables of type `global`. As an example, if you were previously using `{{ "{{ GLOBAL_VAR }}" }}` directly in your
configuration, add a `config_variable` of type `global` with the `id` matching the `id` of the global variable `GLOBAL_VAR`, which can be found in the Synthetics UI or from the output of the `datadog_synthetics_global_variable` resource. The name can be chosen freely. 

In practice, it means going from (simplified configuration):

```
url = {{ "https://{{ GLOBAL_VAR }}" }}
```

to

```
config_variable {
  name = "LOCAL_VAR"
  id = [your_global_variable_id]
  type = "global"
}
```

which you can now use in your request definition:
```
url = {{ "https://{{ LOCAL_VAR }}" }}
```

## Example Usage
{{ tffile "examples/resources/datadog_synthetics_test/resource.tf" }}
