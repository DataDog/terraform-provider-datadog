# datadog_custom_allocation_rule (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve information about an existing custom allocation rule.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `rule_id` (Number) The ID of the custom allocation rule to retrieve.
- `strategy` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--strategy))

### Read-Only

- `costs_to_allocate` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--costs_to_allocate))
- `created` (String) The timestamp (in ISO 8601 format) when the rule was created.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the custom allocation rule is enabled.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `last_modified_user_uuid` (String) The UUID of the user who last modified the rule.
- `order_id` (Number) The order of the rule in the list of custom allocation rules.
- `providernames` (List of String) List of cloud providers the rule applies to (e.g., `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`).
- `rejected` (Boolean) Whether the rule was rejected by Datadog due to runtime errors. This field can be updated well after the rule was created. If rejected this rule is treated as disabled until modified where the rejection status is reset.
- `rule_name` (String) The unique name of the custom allocation rule.
- `type` (String) The type of the custom allocation rule. This is always `shared` currently.
- `updated` (String) The timestamp (in ISO 8601 format) when the rule was last updated.
- `version` (String) The version number of the rule.
