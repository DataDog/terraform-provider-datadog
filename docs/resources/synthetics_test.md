# datadog_synthetics_test Resource

Provides a Datadog synthetics test resource. This can be used to create and manage Datadog synthetics test.

## Example Usage (Synthetics API test)

Create a new Datadog Synthetics API/HTTP test on https://www.example.org

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_api" {
  type = "api"
  subtype = "http"
  request = {
    method = "GET"
    url = "https://www.example.org"
  }
  request_headers = {
    Content-Type = "application/json"
    Authentication = "Token: 1234566789"
  }
  assertion {
      type = "statusCode"
      operator = "is"
      target = "200"
  }
  locations = [ "aws:eu-central-1" ]
  options_list {
    tick_every = 900

    retry {
      count = 2
      interval = 300
    }

    monitor_options = {
      renotify_interval = 100
    }
  }
  name = "An API test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @pagerduty"
  tags = ["foo:bar", "foo", "env:test"]

  status = "live"
}
```

## Example Usage (Synthetics SSL test)

Create a new Datadog Synthetics API/SSL test on example.org

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_ssl" {
  type = "api"
  subtype = "ssl"
  request = {
    host = "example.org"
    port = 443
  }
  assertion {
      type = "certificate"
      operator = "isInMoreThan"
      target = 30
  }
  locations = [ "aws:eu-central-1" ]
  options_list {
    tick_every = 900
    accept_self_signed = true
  }
  name = "An API test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @pagerduty"
  tags = ["foo:bar", "foo", "env:test"]

  status = "live"
}
```

## Example Usage (Synthetics TCP test)

Create a new Datadog Synthetics API/TCP test on example.org

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_tcp" {
  type = "api"
  subtype = "tcp"
  request = {
    host = "example.org"
    port = 443
  }
  assertion {
      type = "responseTime"
      operator = "lessThan"
      target = 2000
  }
  locations = [ "aws:eu-central-1" ]
  options_list {
    tick_every = 900
  }
  name = "An API test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @pagerduty"
  tags = ["foo:bar", "foo", "env:test"]

  status = "live"
}
```

## Example Usage (Synthetics Browser test)

Support for Synthetics Browser test steps is limited (see [below](#synthetics-browser-test))

```hcl
# Create a new Datadog Synthetics Browser test starting on https://www.example.org
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_browser" {
  type = "browser"

  request = {
    method = "GET"
    url    = "https://app.datadoghq.com"
  }

  device_ids = ["laptop_large"]
  locations  = ["aws:eu-central-1"]

  options_list {
    tick_every = 3600
  }

  name = "A Browser test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @qa"
  tags    = []

  status = "paused"

  step {
    name = "Check current url"
    type = "assertCurrentUrl"
    params = jsonencode({
        "check": "contains",
        "value": "datadoghq"
    })
  }
}
```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

- `id`: ID (public_id) of the Datadog synthetics test
- `monitor_id`: ID of the monitor associated with the Datadog synthetics test

## Import

Synthetics tests can be imported using their public string ID, e.g.

```
$ terraform import datadog_synthetics_test.fizz abc-123-xyz
```

## Synthetics Browser test

Support for Synthetics Browser test is limited when creating steps. Some steps types (like steps involving elements) cannot be created, but they can be imported.

## Assertion format

The resource was changed to have assertions be a list of `assertion` blocks instead of single `assertions` array, to support the JSON path operations. We'll remove `assertions` support in the future: to migrate, rename your attribute to `assertion` and turn array elements into independent blocks. For example:

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_api" {
  assertions = [
    {
      type = "statusCode"
      operator = "is"
      target = "200"
    },
    {
      type = "responseTime"
      operator = "lessThan"
      target = "1000"
    }
  ]
}
```

turns into:

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_api" {
  assertion {
      type = "statusCode"
      operator = "is"
      target = "200"
  }
  assertion {
      type = "responsTime"
      operator = "lessThan"
      target = "1000"
  }
}
```
