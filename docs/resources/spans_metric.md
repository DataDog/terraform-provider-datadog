  name = "testing.span.metric"
  compute {
    aggregation_type    = "distribution"
    include_percentiles = false
    path                = "@duration"
  }
  filter {
    query = "@http.status_code:200 service:my-service"
  }

- `aggregation_type` (String) The type of aggregation to use. This field can't be updated after creation.

Optional:

- `include_percentiles` (Boolean) Toggle to include or exclude percentile aggregations for distribution metrics. Only present when the `aggregation_type` is `distribution`.
- `path` (String) The path to the value the span-based metric will aggregate on (only used if the aggregation type is a "distribution"). This field can't be updated after creation.


<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`
