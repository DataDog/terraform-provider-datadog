## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name attribute in the resource `datadog_logs_pipeline_order` needs to be unique. It's recommended to use the same value as the resource name. No related field is available in [Logs Pipeline API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/logs-pipelines/#get-pipeline-order).
- `pipelines` (List of String) The pipeline IDs list. The order of pipeline IDs in this attribute defines the overall pipeline order for logs.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# There must be at most one datadog_logs_pipeline_order resource. Pipeline order creation is not supported from logs config API. You can import the datadog_logs_pipeline_order or create a pipeline order (which is actually doing the update operation).
terraform import <datadog_logs_pipeline_order.name> <name>
```
