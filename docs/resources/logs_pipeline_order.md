# datadog_logs_pipeline_order Resource

Provides a Datadog [Logs Pipeline API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/logs-pipelines/) resource, which is used to manage Datadog log pipelines order.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "datadog_logs_pipeline_order" "sample_pipeline_order" {
    name = "sample_pipeline_order"
    depends_on = [
        "datadog_logs_custom_pipeline.sample_pipeline",
        "datadog_logs_integration_pipeline.python"
    ]
    pipelines = [
        "${datadog_logs_custom_pipeline.sample_pipeline.id}",
        "${datadog_logs_integration_pipeline.python.id}"
    ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name`: (Required) The name attribute in the resource `datadog_logs_pipeline_order` needs to be unique. It's recommended to use the same value as the resource `NAME`. No related field is available in [Logs Pipeline API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/logs-pipelines/#get-pipeline-orderr).
- `pipelines`: (Required) The pipeline IDs list. The order of pipeline IDs in this attribute defines the overall pipeline order for logs.

## Attributes Reference

- `pipelines`: The `pipelines` list contains the IDs of resources created and imported by the [datadog_logs_custom_pipeline](logs_custom_pipeline.html#datadog_logs_custom_pipeline) and [datadog_logs_integration_pipeline](logs_integration_pipeline.html#datadog_logs_integration_pipeline). Updating the order of pipelines in this list reflects the application order of the pipelines. You cannot delete or create pipeline by deleting or adding IDs to this list.

## Import

There must be at most one `datadog_logs_pipeline_order` resource. Pipeline order creation is not supported from logs config API. You can import the `datadog_logs_pipeline_order` or create a pipeline order (which is actually doing the update operation).

```
terraform import <datadog_logs_pipeline_order.name> <name>
```
