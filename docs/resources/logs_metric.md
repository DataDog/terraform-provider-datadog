# datadog_logs_metric (Resource)

Resource for interacting with the logs_metric API

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datadog_logs_metric" "testing_logs_metric" {
  name = "testing.logs.metric"
  compute {
    aggregation_type = "distribution"
    path             = "@duration"
  }
  filter {
    query = "service:test"
  }
  group_by {
    path     = "@status"
    tag_name = "status"
  }
  group_by {
    path     = "@version"
    tag_name = "version"

## Schema

### Required

- `compute` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) The compute rule to compute the log-based metric. This field can't be updated after creation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--compute))
- `filter` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) The log-based metric filter. Logs matching this filter will be aggregated in this metric. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `name` (String) The name of the log-based metric. This field can't be updated after creation.

### Optional

- `group_by` (Block List) The rules for the group by. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group_by))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--compute"></a>
### Nested Schema for `compute`

Required:

- `aggregation_type` (String) The type of aggregation to use. This field can't be updated after creation. Valid values are `count`, `distribution`.

Optional:

- `path` (String) The path to the value the log-based metric will aggregate on (only used if the aggregation type is a "distribution"). This field can't be updated after creation.


<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `query` (String) The search query - following the log search syntax.


<a id="nestedblock--group_by"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_by`

Required:

- `path` (String) The path to the value the log-based metric will be aggregated over.
- `tag_name` (String) Name of the tag that gets created.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import datadog_logs_metric.testing_logs_metric testing.logs.metric
```
