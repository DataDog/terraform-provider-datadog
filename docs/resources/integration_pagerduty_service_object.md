## Schema

### Required

- `service_key` (String, Sensitive) Your Service name associated service key in PagerDuty. This key may also be referred to as an Integration Key or Routing Key in the Pagerduty Integration [documentation](https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/datadog-integration-guide/), UI, and within the [Pagerduty Provider for Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PagerDuty/pagerduty/latest/docs/resources/service_integration#integration_key) Note: Since the Datadog API never returns service keys, it is impossible to detect [drifts](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/detecting-and-managing-drift-with-terraform). The best way to solve a drift is to manually mark the Service Object resource with [terraform taint](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) to have it destroyed and recreated.
- `service_name` (String) Your Service name in PagerDuty.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
