# datadog_application_key (Resource)

Provides a Datadog Application Key resource. This can be used to create and manage Datadog Application Keys. Import functionality for this resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future release with prior notice.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Source the permissions for scoped keys
data "datadog_permissions" "dd_perms" {}

# Create an unrestricted Application Key
# This key inherits all permissions of the user that owns the key
resource "datadog_application_key" "unrestricted_key" {
  name = "Unrestricted Application Key"
  # scopes unset - inherits all user permissions
}

# Create a scoped Application Key for monitor management
resource "datadog_application_key" "monitor_management_key" {
  name = "Monitor Management Key"
  scopes = [
    data.datadog_permissions.dd_perms.permissions.monitors_read,
    data.datadog_permissions.dd_perms.permissions.monitors_write
  ]
