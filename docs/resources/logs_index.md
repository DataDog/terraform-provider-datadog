# datadog_logs_index (Resource)

Provides a Datadog Logs Index API resource. This can be used to create and manage Datadog logs indexes.  
**Note:** It is not possible to delete logs indexes through Terraform, so an index remains in your account after the resource is removed from your terraform config. Reach out to support to delete a logs index.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# A sample Datadog logs index resource definition.

resource "datadog_logs_index" "sample_index" {
  name           = "your index"
  daily_limit    = 200000
  retention_days = 7
  filter {
    query = "*"
  }
  exclusion_filter {
    name       = "Filter coredns logs"
    is_enabled = true
    filter {
      query       = "app:coredns"
      sample_rate = 0.97
    }
  }
  exclusion_filter {
    name       = "Kubernetes apiserver"
    is_enabled = true
    filter {
      query       = "service:kube_apiserver"
      sample_rate = 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **filter** (Block List, Min: 1) Logs filter (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- **name** (String) The name of the index.

### Optional

- **daily_limit** (Number) The number of log events you can send in this index per day before you are rate-limited.
- **disable_daily_limit** (Boolean) If true, sets the daily_limit value to null and the index is not limited on a daily basis (any specified daily_limit value in the request is ignored). If false or omitted, the index's current daily_limit is maintained.
- **exclusion_filter** (Block List) List of exclusion filters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--exclusion_filter))
- **retention_days** (Number) The number of days before logs are deleted from this index.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- **query** (String) Logs filter criteria. Only logs matching this filter criteria are considered for this index.


<a id="nestedblock--exclusion_filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `exclusion_filter`

Optional:

- **filter** (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--exclusion_filter--filter))
- **is_enabled** (Boolean) A boolean stating if the exclusion is active or not.
- **name** (String) The name of the exclusion filter.

<a id="nestedblock--exclusion_filter--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `exclusion_filter.filter`

Optional:

- **query** (String) Only logs matching the filter criteria and the query of the parent index will be considered for this exclusion filter.
- **sample_rate** (Number) The fraction of logs excluded by the exclusion filter, when active.
