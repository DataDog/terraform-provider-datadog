# datadog_security_monitoring_rule (Resource)

Provides a Datadog Security Monitoring Rule API resource. This can be used to create and manage Datadog security monitoring rules. To change settings for a default rule use `datadog_security_default_rule` instead.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datadog_security_monitoring_rule" "myrule" {
  name = "My rule"

  message = "The rule has triggered."
  enabled = true

  query {
    name            = "errors"
    query           = "status:error"
    aggregation     = "count"
    group_by_fields = ["host"]
  }

  query {
    name            = "warnings"
    query           = "status:warning"
    aggregation     = "count"
    group_by_fields = ["host"]
  }

  case {
    status        = "high"
    condition     = "errors > 3 && warnings > 10"
    notifications = ["@user"]
  }

  options {
    evaluation_window   = 300
    keep_alive          = 600
    max_signal_duration = 900
  }

  tags = ["type:dos"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `message` (String) Message for generated signals.
- `name` (String) The name of the rule.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the rule is enabled.
- `filter` (Block List) Additional queries to filter matched events before they are processed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `has_extended_title` (Boolean) Whether the notifications include the triggering group-by values in their title.
- `options` (Block List, Max: 1) Options on rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options))
- `query` (Block List) Queries for selecting logs which are part of the rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--query))
- `signal_query` (Block List) Queries for selecting logs which are part of the rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--signal_query))
- `tags` (List of String) Tags for generated signals.
- `type` (String) The rule type. Valid values are `log_detection`, `workload_security`, `signal_correlation`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--case"></a>
### Nested Schema for `case`

Required:

- `status` (String) Severity of the Security Signal. Valid values are `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.

Optional:

- `condition` (String) A rule case contains logical operations (`>`,`>=`, `&&`, `||`) to determine if a signal should be generated based on the event counts in the previously defined queries.
- `name` (String) Name of the case.
- `notifications` (List of String) Notification targets for each rule case.


<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `action` (String) The type of filtering action. Valid values are `require`, `suppress`.
- `query` (String) Query for selecting logs to apply the filtering action.


<a id="nestedblock--options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `options`

Required:

- `keep_alive` (Number) Once a signal is generated, the signal will remain “open” if a case is matched at least once within this keep alive window. Valid values are `0`, `60`, `300`, `600`, `900`, `1800`, `3600`, `7200`, `10800`, `21600`.
- `max_signal_duration` (Number) A signal will “close” regardless of the query being matched once the time exceeds the maximum duration. This time is calculated from the first seen timestamp. Valid values are `0`, `60`, `300`, `600`, `900`, `1800`, `3600`, `7200`, `10800`, `21600`, `43200`, `86400`.

Optional:

- `decrease_criticality_based_on_env` (Boolean) If true, signals in non-production environments have a lower severity than what is defined by the rule case, which can reduce noise. The decrement is applied when the environment tag of the signal starts with `staging`, `test`, or `dev`. Only available when the rule type is `log_detection`.
- `detection_method` (String) The detection method. Valid values are `threshold`, `new_value`, `anomaly_detection`, `impossible_travel`, `hardcoded`.
- `evaluation_window` (Number) A time window is specified to match when at least one of the cases matches true. This is a sliding window and evaluates in real time. Valid values are `0`, `60`, `300`, `600`, `900`, `1800`, `3600`, `7200`.
- `impossible_travel_options` (Block List, Max: 1) Options for rules using the impossible travel detection method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--impossible_travel_options))
- `new_value_options` (Block List, Max: 1) New value rules specific options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--new_value_options))

<a id="nestedblock--options--impossible_travel_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `options.impossible_travel_options`

Optional:

- `baseline_user_locations` (Boolean) If true, signals are suppressed for the first 24 hours. During that time, Datadog learns the user's regular access locations. This can be helpful to reduce noise and infer VPN usage or credentialed API access.


<a id="nestedblock--options--new_value_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `options.new_value_options`

Required:

- `forget_after` (Number) The duration in days after which a learned value is forgotten. Valid values are `1`, `2`, `7`, `14`, `21`, `28`.

Optional:

- `learning_duration` (Number) The duration in days during which values are learned, and after which signals will be generated for values that weren't learned. If set to 0, a signal will be generated for all new values after the first value is learned. Valid values are `0`, `1`, `7`.
- `learning_method` (String) The learning method used to determine when signals should be generated for values that weren't learned. Valid values are `duration`, `threshold`.
- `learning_threshold` (Number) A number of occurrences after which signals are generated for values that weren't learned. Valid values are `0`, `1`.



<a id="nestedblock--query"></a>
### Nested Schema for `query`

Required:

- `query` (String) Query to run on logs.

Optional:

- `agent_rule` (Block List, Deprecated) **Deprecated**. It won't be applied anymore. **Deprecated.** `agent_rule` has been deprecated in favor of new Agent Rule resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--query--agent_rule))
- `aggregation` (String) The aggregation type. For Signal Correlation rules, it must be event_count. Valid values are `count`, `cardinality`, `sum`, `max`, `new_value`, `geo_data`, `event_count`.
- `distinct_fields` (List of String) Field for which the cardinality is measured. Sent as an array.
- `group_by_fields` (List of String) Fields to group by.
- `metric` (String, Deprecated) The target field to aggregate over when using the `sum`, `max`, or `geo_data` aggregations. **Deprecated.** Configure `metrics` instead. This attribute will be removed in the next major version of the provider.
- `metrics` (List of String) Group of target fields to aggregate over when using the `sum`, `max`, `geo_data`, or `new_value` aggregations. The `sum`, `max`, and `geo_data` aggregations only accept one value in this list, whereas the `new_value` aggregation accepts up to five values.
- `name` (String) Name of the query. Not compatible with `new_value` aggregations.

<a id="nestedblock--query--agent_rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `query.agent_rule`

Required:

- `agent_rule_id` (String) **Deprecated**. It won't be applied anymore.
- `expression` (String) **Deprecated**. It won't be applied anymore.



<a id="nestedblock--signal_query"></a>
### Nested Schema for `signal_query`

Required:

- `rule_id` (String) Rule ID of the signal to correlate.

Optional:

- `aggregation` (String) The aggregation type. For Signal Correlation rules, it must be event_count. Valid values are `count`, `cardinality`, `sum`, `max`, `new_value`, `geo_data`, `event_count`.
- `correlated_by_fields` (List of String) Fields to correlate by.
- `correlated_query_index` (String) Index of the rule query used to retrieve the correlated field. An empty string applies correlation on the non-projected per query attributes of the rule.
- `default_rule_id` (String) Default Rule ID of the signal to correlate. This value is READ-ONLY.
- `name` (String) Name of the query. Not compatible with `new_value` aggregations.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Security monitoring rules can be imported using ID, e.g.
terraform import datadog_security_monitoring_rule.my_rule m0o-hto-lkb
```
