# datadog_security_monitoring_rule (Resource)

Provides a Datadog Security Monitoring Rule API resource. This can be used to create and manage Datadog security monitoring rules. To change settings for a default rule use `datadog_security_default_rule` instead.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datadog_security_monitoring_rule" "myrule" {
  name = "My rule"

  message = "The rule has triggered."
  enabled = true

  query {
    name            = "errors"
    query           = "status:error"
    aggregation     = "count"
    group_by_fields = ["host"]
  }

  query {
    name            = "warnings"
    query           = "status:warning"
    aggregation     = "count"
    group_by_fields = ["host"]
  }

  case {
    status        = "high"
    condition     = "errors > 3 && warnings > 10"
    notifications = ["@user"]
  }

  options {
    evaluation_window   = 300
    keep_alive          = 600
    max_signal_duration = 900
  }

  tags = ["type:dos"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **case** (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 5) Cases for generating signals. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--case))
- **message** (String) Message for generated signals.
- **name** (String) The name of the rule.
- **query** (Block List, Min: 1) Queries for selecting logs which are part of the rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--query))

### Optional

- **enabled** (Boolean) Whether the rule is enabled.
- **filter** (Block List) Additional queries to filter matched events before they are processed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- **has_extended_title** (Boolean) Whether the notifications include the triggering group-by values in their title.
- **options** (Block List, Max: 1) Options on rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options))
- **tags** (List of String) Tags for generated signals.
- **type** (String) The rule type. Valid values are `log_detection`, `infrastructure_configuration`, `workload_security`, `cloud_configuration`.

### Read-only

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--case"></a>
### Nested schema for `case`

Required:

- **status** (String) Severity of the Security Signal. Valid values are `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.

Optional:

- **condition** (String) A rule case contains logical operations (`>`,`>=`, `&&`, `||`) to determine if a signal should be generated based on the event counts in the previously defined queries.
- **name** (String) Name of the case.
- **notifications** (List of String) Notification targets for each rule case.


<a id="nestedblock--query"></a>
### Nested schema for `query`

Required:

- **query** (String) Query to run on logs.

Optional:

- **agent_rule** (Block List) The agent rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--query--agent_rule))
- **aggregation** (String) The aggregation type. Valid values are `count`, `cardinality`, `sum`, `max`, `new_value`.
- **distinct_fields** (List of String) Field for which the cardinality is measured. Sent as an array.
- **group_by_fields** (List of String) Fields to group by.
- **metric** (String) The target field to aggregate over when using the sum or max aggregations.
- **name** (String) Name of the query.

<a id="nestedblock--query--agent_rule"></a>
### Nested schema for `query.agent_rule`

Required:

- **agent_rule_id** (String) The Agent rule ID. Must be unique within the rule.
- **expression** (String) A Runtime Security expression determines what activity should be collected by the Datadog Agent. These logical expressions can use predefined operators and attributes. Tags cannot be used in Runtime Security expressions. Instead, allow or deny based on tags under the advanced option.



<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested schema for `filter`

Required:

- **action** (String) The type of filtering action. Valid values are `require`, `suppress`.
- **query** (String) Query for selecting logs to apply the filtering action.


<a id="nestedblock--options"></a>
### Nested schema for `options`

Required:

- **evaluation_window** (Number) A time window is specified to match when at least one of the cases matches true. This is a sliding window and evaluates in real time. Valid values are `0`, `60`, `300`, `600`, `900`, `1800`, `3600`, `7200`.
- **keep_alive** (Number) Once a signal is generated, the signal will remain “open” if a case is matched at least once within this keep alive window. Valid values are `0`, `60`, `300`, `600`, `900`, `1800`, `3600`, `7200`, `10800`, `21600`.
- **max_signal_duration** (Number) A signal will “close” regardless of the query being matched once the time exceeds the maximum duration. This time is calculated from the first seen timestamp. Valid values are `0`, `60`, `300`, `600`, `900`, `1800`, `3600`, `7200`, `10800`, `21600`, `43200`, `86400`.

Optional:

- **detection_method** (String) The detection method. Valid values are `threshold`, `new_value`, `anomaly_detection`.
- **new_value_options** (Block List, Max: 1) New value rules specific options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--options--new_value_options))

<a id="nestedblock--options--new_value_options"></a>
### Nested schema for `options.new_value_options`

Required:

- **forget_after** (Number) The duration in days after which a learned value is forgotten. Valid values are `1`, `2`, `7`, `14`, `21`, `28`.
- **learning_duration** (Number) The duration in days during which values are learned, and after which signals will be generated for values that weren't learned. If set to 0, a signal will be generated for all new values after the first value is learned. Valid values are `0`, `1`, `7`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Security monitoring rules can be imported using ID, e.g.
terraform import datadog_security_monitoring_rule.my_rule m0o-hto-lkb
```
