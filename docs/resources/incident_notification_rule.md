EOF
  category     = "alert"
  incident_type = datadog_incident_type.example.id
}

resource "datadog_incident_notification_rule" "example" {
  enabled     = true
  trigger     = "incident_created_trigger"
  visibility  = "organization"
  
  handles = [
    "@team-email@company.com",
    "@slack-channel-alerts",
    "@pagerduty-service"
  ]
  
  # Trigger for SEV-1 and SEV-2 incidents
  conditions {
    field = "severity"
    values = ["SEV-1", "SEV-2"]
  }
  
  # Also trigger for incidents affecting production services
  conditions {
    field = "services"
    values = ["web-service", "api-service", "database-service"]
  }
  
  # Re-notify when status or severity changes
  renotify_on = ["status", "severity"]
  
  # Associate with incident type
  incident_type = datadog_incident_type.example.id
  
  # Use custom notification template
