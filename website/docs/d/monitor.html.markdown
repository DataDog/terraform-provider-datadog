# datadog_monitor

Use this data source to retrieve information about an existing monitor for use in other resources.

## Example Usage

```
data "datadog_monitor" "test" {
  name_filter = "My awesome monitor"
  monitor_tags_filter = ["foo:bar"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

 * `name_filter` - (Optional) A monitor name to limit the search.
 * `tags_filter` - (Optional) A list of tags to limit the search. This filters on the monitor scope.
 * `monitor_tags_filter` - (Optional) A list of monitor tags to limit the search. This filters on the tags set on the monitor itself.
 
 ~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail.
 Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a single monitor.
