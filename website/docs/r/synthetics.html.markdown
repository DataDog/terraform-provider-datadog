# datadog_synthetics_test

Provides a Datadog synthetics test resource. This can be used to create and manage Datadog synthetics test.

## Example Usage (Synthetics API test)

Create a new Datadog Synthetics API/HTTP test on https://www.example.org

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_api" {
  type = "api"
  subtype = "http"
  request = {
    method = "GET"
    url = "https://www.example.org"
  }
  request_headers = {
    Content-Type = "application/json"
    Authentication = "Token: 1234566789"
  }
  assertions = [
    {
      type = "statusCode"
      operator = "is"
      target = "200"
    }
  ]
  locations = [ "aws:eu-central-1" ]
  options = {
    tick_every = 900
  }
  name = "An API test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @pagerduty"
  tags = ["foo:bar", "foo", "env:test"]

  status = "live"
}
```

## Example Usage (Synthetics SSL test)

Create a new Datadog Synthetics API/SSL test on example.org

```hcl
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_ssl" {
  type = "api"
  subtype = "ssl"
  request = {
    host = "example.org"
    port = 443
  }
  assertions = [
    {
      type = "certificate"
      operator = "isInMoreThan"
      target = 30
    }
  ]
  locations = [ "aws:eu-central-1" ]
  options = {
    tick_every = 900
    accept_self_signed = true
  }
  name = "An API test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @pagerduty"
  tags = ["foo:bar", "foo", "env:test"]

  status = "live"
}
```

## Example Usage (Synthetics Browser test)

Support for Synthetics Browser test is limited (see [below](#synthetics-browser-test))

```hcl
# Create a new Datadog Synthetics Browser test starting on https://www.example.org
resource "datadog_synthetics_test" "test_browser" {
  type = "browser"

  request = {
    method = "GET"
    url    = "https://app.datadoghq.com"
  }

  device_ids = ["laptop_large"]
  locations  = ["aws:eu-central-1"]

  options = {
    tick_every = 3600
  }

  name = "A Browser test on example.org"
  message = "Notify @qa"
  tags    = []

  status = "paused"
}
```

  - `method` - (Optional) For type=api and subtype=http, one of DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT
  - `url` - (Required) Any url
  - `timeout` - (Optional) For type=api, any value between 0 and 60 (Default = 60)
  - `body` - (Optional) Request body
- `request` - (Required) if type=api and subtype=ssl
  - `host` - (Required) host name
  - `port` - (Required) port number
  - `timeout` - (Optional) For type=api, any value between 0 and 60 (Default = 60)
- `request` - (Required) if type=browser
  - `method` - (Required) no-op, use GET
  - `url` - (Required) Any url
- `request_headers` - (Optional) Header name and value map
- `assertions` - (Required) Array of 1 to 10 items, only some combinations of type/operator are valid (please refer to Datadog documentation)
  - `type` - (Required) body, header, responseTime, statusCode
  - `operator` - (Required) Please refer to [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_test/#validation) as operator depend on assertion type
  - `target` - (Required) Expected value, please refer to [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_test/#validation) as target depend on assertion type
  - `property` - (Optional) if assertion type is "header", this is a the header name
- `options` - (Required)
  - `tick_every` - (Required)  How often the test should run (in seconds). Current possible values are 900, 1800, 3600, 21600, 43200, 86400, 604800 plus 60 if type=api or 300 if type=browser
  - `follow_redirects` - (Optional) For type=api, true or false
  - `min_failure_duration` - (Optional) How long the test should be in failure before alerting (integer, number of seconds, max 7200). Default is 0.
  - `min_location_failed` - (Optional) Threshold below which a synthetics test is allowed to fail before sending notifications
  - `accept_self_signed` - (Optional) For type=ssl, true or false

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

- `public_id` - ID of the Datadog synthetics test

## Import

Synthetics tests can be imported using their public string ID, e.g.

```
$ terraform import datadog_synthetics_test.fizz abc-123-xyz
```

## Synthetics Browser test

Support for Synthetics Browser test is limited to creating shallow Synthetics Browser test (cf. [example usage below](#example-usage-synthetics-browser-test-))

You cannot create/edit/delete steps or assertions via Terraform unless you use [Datadog WebUI](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/list) in conjunction with Terraform.

We are considering adding support for Synthetics Browser test steps and assertions in the future but can't share any release date on that matter.
