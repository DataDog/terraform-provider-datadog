      Goal\nDetect Account Take Over (ATO) through credential stuffing attack.\n\nA
      credential stuffing attack is used to gain initial access by compromising user
      accounts.\n\nThe attacker obtains a list of compromised usernames and passwords
      from a previous user database breach, phishing attempt, or other means. Then,
      they use the list of username and passwords to attempt to login to accounts
      on your application.\n\nIt is common for an attacker to use multiple IP addresses
      to target your application in order to distribute the attack load for load balancing
      purposes, to make it more difficult to detect, or make it more difficult to
      block.\n\n### Strategy\n**To determine a successful attempt:** Detect a high
      number of failed logins from at least 25 unique users and at least one successful
      login for a user within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n**To determine
      an unsuccessful attempt:** Detect a high number of failed logins from at least
      ten unique users within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n### Triage

      Goal\nDetect Account Take Over (ATO) through credential stuffing attack.\n\nA
      credential stuffing attack is used to gain initial access by compromising user
      accounts.\n\nThe attacker obtains a list of compromised usernames and passwords
      from a previous user database breach, phishing attempt, or other means. Then,
      they use the list of username and passwords to attempt to login to accounts
      on your application.\n\nIt is common for an attacker to use multiple IP addresses
      to target your application in order to distribute the attack load for load balancing
      purposes, to make it more difficult to detect, or make it more difficult to
      block.\n\n### Strategy\n**To determine a successful attempt:** Detect a high
      number of failed logins from at least 25 unique users and at least one successful
      login for a user within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n**To determine
      an unsuccessful attempt:** Detect a high number of failed logins from at least
      ten unique users within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n### Triage

      Goal\nDetect Account Take Over (ATO) through credential stuffing attack.\n\nA
      credential stuffing attack is used to gain initial access by compromising user
      accounts.\n\nThe attacker obtains a list of compromised usernames and passwords
      from a previous user database breach, phishing attempt, or other means. Then,
      they use the list of username and passwords to attempt to login to accounts
      on your application.\n\nIt is common for an attacker to use multiple IP addresses
      to target your application in order to distribute the attack load for load balancing
      purposes, to make it more difficult to detect, or make it more difficult to
      block.\n\n### Strategy\n**To determine a successful attempt:** Detect a high
      number of failed logins from at least 25 unique users and at least one successful
      login for a user within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n**To determine
      an unsuccessful attempt:** Detect a high number of failed logins from at least
      ten unique users within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n### Triage

      Goal\nDetect Account Take Over (ATO) through credential stuffing attack.\n\nA
      credential stuffing attack is used to gain initial access by compromising user
      accounts.\n\nThe attacker obtains a list of compromised usernames and passwords
      from a previous user database breach, phishing attempt, or other means. Then,
      they use the list of username and passwords to attempt to login to accounts
      on your application.\n\nIt is common for an attacker to use multiple IP addresses
      to target your application in order to distribute the attack load for load balancing
      purposes, to make it more difficult to detect, or make it more difficult to
      block.\n\n### Strategy\n**To determine a successful attempt:** Detect a high
      number of failed logins from at least 25 unique users and at least one successful
      login for a user within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n**To determine
      an unsuccessful attempt:** Detect a high number of failed logins from at least
      ten unique users within a period of time from the same IP address.\n\n### Triage
