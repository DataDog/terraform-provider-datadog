# datadog-api-client-go

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/DataDog/datadog-api-client-go/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=9Vx8eU0VlA)](https://codecov.io/gh/DataDog/datadog-api-client-go)

This repository contains a Go API client for the [Datadog API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/).
The code is generated using [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
and [apigentools](https://github.com/DataDog/apigentools).

## Layout

This repository contains per-major-version API client packages. Right
now, Datadog only has one API version - `v1` - so that is the only module present. If/when
there is another version of the API, we will add a different package for it. The end goal is
to be able to use API clients for different major versions of the API side-by-side.

## The Datadog API v1 Client

The client library for Datadog API v1 is located in the `api/v1/datadog` directory. Import it with

```go
import "github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-go/api/v1/datadog"
```

All the documentation for this package is available through `api/v1/datadog/README.md`.


### Unstable Endpoints

This client includes access to Datadog API endpoints while they are in an unstable state and may undergo breaking changes. An extra configuration step is required to enable these endpoints:

```go
Client(ctx).GetConfig().SetUnstableOperationEnabled("<OperationName>", true)
```

where `<OperationName>` is the name of the method used to interact with that endpoint. For example: `GetLogsIndex`, or `UpdateLogsIndex`

## Contributing

As most of the code in this repository is generated, we will only accept PRs for files
that are not modified by our code-generation machinery (changes to the generated files
would get overwritten). We happily accept contributions to files that are not autogenerated, such as tests and development tooling.
